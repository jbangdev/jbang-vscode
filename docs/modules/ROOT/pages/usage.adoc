This page describes how to use the JBang extension for Visual Studio Code to work with Java scripts.

== Completion

* **Directive Completion**: Start typing `//` at the top of your Java file to get completions for JBang directives like `//DEPS`, `//SOURCES`, etc.
* **Dependency Completion**: In a `//DEPS` line, start typing a Maven group or artifact (e.g., `org.apache.commons:`) and press `Ctrl+Space` (or `Cmd+Space` on Mac) to trigger completion for Maven artifacts and versions.
* **Catalog Completion**: In `jbang-catalog.json`, get completion for script references and aliases.

== Running and Debugging

* Use the codelens links ("Run JBang" or "Debug JBang") that appear above the main method or class declaration in your script.
* You can also right-click a script file and select `Run JBang` or `Debug JBang` from the context menu.

== Dependency Management

* When you edit `//DEPS` lines, the classpath is automatically updated for the script.
* To synchronize dependencies with a Maven or Gradle project, right-click the script and select `JBang > Synchronize JBang`.

== Script Templates

* Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `JBang: Create a new script` to start a new script from a template.

== Advanced Usage

* **Export as Native Binary**: Right-click a script and select `JBang > Export as native binary` (requires GraalVM with native-image).
* **Install as Application**: Right-click a script and select `JBang > install application` to add it to your PATH.

== Tips

* If completions or classpath updates do not work as expected, try running `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace` from the command palette and reload the window.
* For more information, see the [project README](https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-vscode#readme) or the [JBang documentation](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/).
