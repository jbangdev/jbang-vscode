The JBang VS Code extension brings the power and convenience of link:https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] scripts to Visual Studio Code, with rich editing, completion, and project management features for Java scripts.

== Features

* **JBang Script Project Support**: Open a folder with JBang scripts to automatically configure classpaths and project structure.
* **Directive Snippets & Completion**: Autocomplete for JBang directives like `//DEPS`, `//SOURCES`, `//FILES`, and more.
* **Dependency Completion**: Smart suggestions for Maven coordinates in `//DEPS`, including group, artifact, and version.
* **Hover Documentation**: See dependency documentation and details on hover and completion.
* **Run & Debug**: Run or debug JBang scripts directly from the editor using codelens or context menu.
* **Synchronize with Build Tools**: Sync JBang dependencies with Maven/Gradle projects.
* **Script Templates**: Create new scripts from templates with the `JBang: Create a new script` command.
* **Annotation Processor Support**: Automatically configures annotation processors for your scripts.
* **Native Image Export**: Export scripts as native binaries (requires GraalVM).
* **Install as Application**: Install scripts as command-line applications.
* **JBang Catalogs**: Autocomplete for `jbang-catalog.json` files.

== Getting Started

. **Install Prerequisites**
  * [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/download/) (add to your PATH or set `jbang.home` in VS Code settings)
  * [Language Support for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
. **Install the Extension**
  * Search for "JBang" in the VS Code Marketplace and install.
. **Open or Create a JBang Script**
  * Open a folder with `.java` scripts containing JBang directives (e.g., `//DEPS`).
  * Use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `JBang: Create a new script` to start from a template.
. **Edit, Run, and Debug**
  * Use autocompletion for dependencies and directives.
  * Run or debug scripts via codelens above the main method or type declaration, or right-click for more options.

== Preferences

* `jbang.home`: Path to JBang installation (if not in PATH)
* `jbang.wizard.templates.showDescriptions`: Show template descriptions in the script wizard
* `java.import.jbang.projectPerScript`: Import each script as its own project (requires workspace clean to take effect)
* `jbang.completion.onSelect.autosave`: Auto-save after selecting a dependency completion

== Advanced Usage

* **Synchronize with Maven/Gradle**: Right-click a script and select `JBang > Synchronize JBang` to add dependencies to your project.
* **Export Native Binary**: Right-click and select `JBang > Export as native binary` (requires GraalVM with native-image).
* **Install as App**: Right-click and select `JBang > install application` to add your script to the PATH.

== Development Setup

. Clone this repository and [jbangdev/jbang-eclipse](https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-eclipse) under the same parent directory.
. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
. Run `npm run build-ext` to build the Eclipse integration (places jars in `jars/`).
. Run `npx vsce package` to build the VSIX extension package.

== Troubleshooting

* If classpath or completions do not update, try running `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace` and reload the window.
* For issues with `build.jbang`, manual synchronization may be required.
