== Getting Started

. **Install Prerequisites**
  * link:https://www.jbang.dev/download/[JBang] (add to your PATH or set `jbang.home` in VS Code settings)
  * link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java[Language Support for Java]
. **Install the Extension**
  * Search for "JBang" in the VS Code Marketplace and install.
. **Open or Create a JBang Script**
  * Open a folder with `.java` scripts containing JBang directives (e.g., `//DEPS`).
  * Use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `JBang: Create a new script` to start from a template.
. **Edit, Run, and Debug**
  * Use autocompletion for dependencies and directives.
  * Run or debug scripts via codelens above the main method or type declaration, or right-click for more options.

== Preferences

* `jbang.home`: Path to JBang installation (if not in PATH)
* `jbang.wizard.templates.showDescriptions`: Show template descriptions in the script wizard
* `java.import.jbang.projectPerScript`: Import each script as its own project (requires workspace clean to take effect)
* `jbang.completion.onSelect.autosave`: Auto-save after selecting a dependency completion

== Troubleshooting

* If classpath or completions do not update, try running `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace` and reload the window.
* For issues with `build.jbang`, manual synchronization may be required.
